# Econometrics
Econometrics models from scratch


# ARIMA Models.py

One can find code (built from scratch) to fit the data to a model from the ARMA familly. 3 methods have been implemented to fit the data with an AR(p) (Yule Walker, Least Square and Conditional Maximum Likelihood), 1 method have been implemented to fit the data with the MA(q) and 1 method have been implemented to fit the data with the ARMA(p,q). Results are very close from those found using the statsmodels package.

# SolvingLinearSystems.py 

One can find a script to solve a linear system using the Cholesky decomposition method. The program is not efficient (the running time for high dimentional matrix is high).

# MarkovChains.py

One can find a method to compute the long run probabilities of states, and a method to evaluate the probability of reaching state j from state i after n steps. One can also find the code for the forward algortihm.
The script will be updated until the replication of the results found in: Stock Price Prediction using Hidden Markov Model, (Nguyen, 2016)

# garch11

One can find a garch(1,1) model. It will be extended to a garch(p,q) soon.

Note: I am aware that errors/ wrong implementations are possible and I please you to send me an email if you notice an (some) error(s). It would be very helpful, and will help me to improve myself. Here is my mail address: nicolas.manelli013@gmail.com
